Leyte congressman Roger Mercado said in a radio interview that the village had a population of 3,000 to 4,000 and expressed fears that as many as 2,000 people had been buried.
Lerias called for more rescuers to come to the site to help look for bodies as heavy earth moving equipment could not work in the mud, which officials said was more than six metres (yards) deep in many areas.
Volunteer rescue teams from the countryâ€™s mining companies, skilled in digging through the earth to rescue people, were also going to the area, President Arroyo said.
Lerias said a smaller landslide later in the afternoon caused no damage but left many of the rescuers worried about a possible new disaster.
Relief groups called for drinking water, food, blankets and body bags to be brought to the scene.
